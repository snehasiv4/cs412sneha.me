                Howdy!
                My name is Sneha Sivakumar. I am a Junior Computer Science student minoring in Statistics at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html"> Texas A&M University</a>. 
                My passion for pursuing a career in the technology field stems from my fascination with the everchanging field of technology and 
                with the desire to help advocate for a stronger female representation in this field. 
                From an early age, my fascination with technology rose as I actively sought out opportunities that fostered my passion for 
                Computer Science and its endless possibilities.

                This past summer, I interned at <a href="https://www.halliburton.com/"> Halliburton</a> as a Research & Development – Software Development intern for the Production Solutions team. 
                My project focused on enabling real-time data communication of the oil wells to Halliburton’s Well Intervention software using OPC UA. 
                I was able to significantly contribute to the possibility of equipment automation and understand how the data I acquired in my project can be 
                utilized to enhance efficiency.

                In addition, I was given the opportunity to serve as the Registration Coordinator for an annual engineering event that Texas A&M University’s 
                Student Engineers’ Council hosts, and was able to integrate and expand my knowledge in programming to solve issues. One particular issue we encountered was 
                with the registration platform where the applicant’s sign-up information was transferred to Excel in a disorganized and cluttered format. 
                So, I took the initiative to use what I know about manipulating Excel sheets with Python and quickly learned to utilize the Pandas library to efficiently create an organized and 
                readable sign-up information sheet that can be easily shared with my team. This in turn helped strengthen communication within my team and ultimately even helped the Finance Chair
                 in identifying participants who needed refunds and reimbursements quickly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These experiences have heightened my deep interest and passion for Data Science and Analytics and pushed me to dive deeper into how this special field
                 contributes in other ways: helping maximize a company’s finances, mitigating and identifying potential risks, and even helping with decision-making. 
                 The way data can be utilized to derive a multitude of solutions and ideas inspires me to pursue a career in the field of Data Science, 
                 and it might even be because of my interest in math!
