            <p class="servbio">As a part of <a href="https://www.jahouston.org/" >Junior Achievement</a>, I was able to teach elementary students 
                about business principles and how businesses affect our region. It gave me the opportunity
                to contribute to these students' interest in pursuing a career in business.
